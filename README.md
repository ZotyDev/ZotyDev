ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ZotyDev, a solo game/engine developer.
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m really interested in programming, games and AI. I also really like playing TRPGs, specially those that have fantasy, magic, sci-fi and creatures.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning almost everything that is needed to create a game and a game engine for it.
