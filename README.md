- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ZotyDev, a solo game developer.
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m really interested in programming, games and AI. I also like playing TRPGs since fantasy, magic, sci-fi, monsters and creatures is something that I also like very much.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning almost everything needed to create a game and a game engine for it.
